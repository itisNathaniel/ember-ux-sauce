# Form Controls

The form control component is used as a container for a form input, label, validation & other common form UI.

## Common Usage

Let's look at a common example where we define the controls child elements through properties:

## Custom Usage

Although the above should cover 90% of your common use cases, we can customise the control with contextual components:

{{docs/uxs-form-control/contextual-demo}}

{{args-table/align-options}}
{{args-table/form-type-options}}
{{args-table/size-options}}
{{args-table/style-options}}
{{args-table/weight-options}}
