# Buttons

The button component is used for clickable actions. This could be to submit a form or to trigger an ember action.

## Usage

Let's look at a basic example. You can play around with some of the arguments in this demo. To see a full list check out the [api page](/docs/api/components/uxs-button)

## Actions

Finally, this component fires an action on tap/click. Actions are passed as [closure actions](https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/10/29/ember-best-practice-stop-bubbling-and-use-closure-actions). The action will not be fired if the component is disabled.
