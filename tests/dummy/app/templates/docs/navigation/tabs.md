# Tabs

Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactions. The _uxs-tabs_ component yields tab _items_ or _item-links_ for each tab you want to display

## Usage

Let's look at a basic example. You can play around with some of the arguments in this demo. To see a full list check out the [api page](../api/components/uxs-tabs)

{{docs/uxs-tabs/basic-demo}}

## Explanation,

_uxs-tabs_ is the wrapping component

The contextual component _tab.link_ is an alias to embers core _link-to_ component. So you can use tab items that act link links.

The _demo.item_ component lets you render tab items that are not links. So you can bind action events to them instead.
