# List Subheadings

Subheadings are used to group list items. You can group a flat model collection with an addon like [ember-cli-group-by](https://github.com/scottwernervt/ember-cli-group-by).

## Usage

## Yield Examples

The subheading can yield subcomponents to provide some more functionality like toggles and icons. To use the yeild component make sure you set the _yield_ argument to **true**.
