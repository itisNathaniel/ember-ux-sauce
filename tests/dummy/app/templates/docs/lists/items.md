## Adding more content

This is a list contains some meta data and includes a bottom border. By defining the lines & border property on the list component, these properties are passed to each item and will set the height and bottom-border.

## Avatars and Actions

This is a list that includes some horizontal layout for the avatar and item. We use the aside and body contextual components to split up each items layout.
There is a variaty of avatar components you can use in lists including: image, text and icon avatars. See the {{link-to "avatars page" "docs.lists.avatars"}} for details.
