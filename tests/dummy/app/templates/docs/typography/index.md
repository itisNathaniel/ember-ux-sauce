# Typography

Common typography styles & components.

## The Type System

The type scale is based on [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#applying-the-type-scale) includes a range of contrasting styles that support the needs of your product and its content.

The type scale is a combination of 13 styles that are supported by the type system. It contains reusable categories of text, each with an intended application and meaning.

## Components

### Headlines

In the type scale, headlines span from a range of 1 through 6. Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals.

Caption and overline text (text with a line above it) are the smallest font sizes. They are used sparingly to annotate imagery or to introduce a headline.
