This Addon aims to provice the basic componets found in most Ember projects at Sauce. These components share common api's and also at common css styleguide.

The styleguide in the addon is designed to be customisable to suit each project. Customisation can start from tweaking fonts and colors all the way to spacing and vertical rhythm.
